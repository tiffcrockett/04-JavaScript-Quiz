#Overview 
This JavaScript Quiz is a 9-question multiple choice timed application that covers the basics of JavaScript.  The application runs in the browser and dynamically updates HTML and CSS. The interface is user-friendly and is responsive, adapting to multiple screens. The user clicks a start button to begin.  As the 60sec timer starts, the user is presented with the first question.  A correct answer progresses the application to the next question.  An incorrect answer subtracts 5 seconds from the timer before advancing to the next question. When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over.  The application advances to a page for the user to save their initials and score.  The user's saved information can be accessed by clicking the View High Scores button, which holds the data until removed by the Clear High Scores Button.  The Start Over button resets the application for the user to begin the quiz again. 

This is my second JavaScript application. The quiz functions and logically progresses, but I found it very challenging.  Mostly, I was not prepared for how adding a timer would affect my code.  It took me quite a while to figure out how to code the timer and target a block that is in the latter portion of the loadNextQuestion function and have the application continue properly. I was able to resolve the problem. To do this type of project again, I would incorporate the timer into the code as I developed it and not add it to existing logic at the end.  This was a good lesson in the benefits of thorough project planning.
